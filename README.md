# Stock-Price-Prediction-and-Analysis
This project is a comprehensive exploration and implementation of machine learning techniques for predicting stock prices. The notebook begins with data acquisition, where stock market data is fetched and preprocessed for analysis. Key features of the project include:

1) Data Preprocessing: The project showcases how to clean and prepare stock market data for analysis, ensuring data quality and usability.

2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): This section involves an in-depth analysis of the stock data, including visualization of trends and patterns.

3) Feature Engineering: The project demonstrates the creation of new features from the raw data, which are crucial for improving the predictive model's accuracy.

4) Model Building: Various machine learning models are constructed, trained, and evaluated. The project explores different algorithms and their effectiveness in stock price prediction.

5) Prediction and Evaluation: The notebook presents the model's predictions and evaluates its performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Coefficient of Determination (R^2). Visualizations comparing actual and predicted stock prices are included to illustrate the model's accuracy.

6) Insights and Conclusions: The project concludes with insights drawn from the analysis and predictions, discussing the model's strengths and areas for improvement.

Technologies and Libraries Used:
Python
Pandas for data manipulation
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
Scikit-learn for machine learning models

Project Objective:
